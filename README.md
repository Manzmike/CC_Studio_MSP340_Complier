#Reason for Proejct
- As a Embedded Software Engineering/PCB Engineering with Emebedded Expirence I will need to be adiquite with Embedded Engineering on a prototype (evaluation board). 
- In most phases you'll be given software reqirements before the pcb is finished. 
- So by protoptying software you can finish most if not all designs. 
- On this case its called a evualtion board for devices. 

#Design Programing for this proejct. 
_ SInce I will be creating a complete smart mirror with usb-c protocols with their on bare metal incoeprations I am 

#Requirements:
MSP430 Complier From TExas Intsruments



#Software Reconmendations 
What am I using? 
- Cocde Complie Studio (CCStudio)
- MSP430 GCC Complier
- MAC OS Operating System 


#Hardware 
- MSP430 TI Hardware Bring Up 


#Steps for Recreations:
- Open CCStudio
- Navigate to Devtools 
- Select the Hardware Device most simlar to youre current hardware ( for me working on a MSP430 - EXP430G2ET) 
- Navigate back to the CCStudio and under Start Section select "Browse and Import Examples"

- Navigate to the blink.c under /examples run code to 
- Download the code onto the board either duing the build or debug
- run the code example on your board and notice the change of the led
