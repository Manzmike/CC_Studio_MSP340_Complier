# Code Explanation

This code snippet demonstrates how to blink an LED on a microcontroller by toggling an output pin. The hardware used for this demonstration is available on Amazon: [Microcontroller Kit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07J3R15JB/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).

```c
int main(void)
{
    volatile unsigned int i;
    WDTCTL = WDTPW + WDTHOLD;                 // Stop watchdog timer
    P1DIR |= 0x01;                            // Set P1.0 to output direction

    while(1)
    {
        P1OUT ^= 0x01;                        // Toggle P1.0 using exclusive-OR

        for (i=10000; i>0; i--);              // Delay loop
    }
}
```

## Explanation of Key Components

- `volatile unsigned int i;`
  - Declares a variable `i` as `volatile`, indicating to the compiler that the value of `i` can change at any moment.

- `WDTCTL = WDTPW + WDTHOLD;`
  - Disables the watchdog timer, which is used to automatically reset the microcontroller if the software becomes unresponsive.

- `P1DIR |= 0x01;`
  - Sets the direction of pin 1.0 (P1.0) to output by performing a bitwise OR operation with the current value of `P1DIR` and `0x01`.

- `P1OUT ^= 0x01;`
  - Toggles the output state of P1.0 using a bitwise XOR operation between the current value of `P1OUT` and `0x01`.

- `for (i=10000; i>0; i--);`
  - Implements a delay loop that counts down from 10000 to 1, creating a noticeable delay for the human eye to observe the LED blinking.
